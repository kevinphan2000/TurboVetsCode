# Turbovets
A demo on full stack task management with a backend on NestJS + TypeORM + JWT and an Angular + TailwindCSS frontend. Features org scoped RBAC (Owner/Admin/Viewer) and JWT authenticated role inheritance with audit logs and a drag and drop dashboard.

1) Quick Start
Prerequisites
Node 20+ (recommended for Angular 20 / Nx 21), for example with nvm

nvm install 20 && nvm use 20
npm (comes with Node).

For development, SQLite or for production, PostgreSQL. No additional setup is required for SQLite.

Clone & Install
git clone <your-repo-url> turbovets

cd turbovets

npm i
Environment (.env at repo root)
Add a new file and name it .env, insert the content below (SQLite for development):

# Auth
JWT_SECRET=devsupersecret
JWT_EXPIRES=3600s

# DB (dev)
DB_TYPE=sqlite
DB_DATABASE=./tmp/turbovets.sqlite
TYPEORM_SYNC=true # dev only; use migrations for prod
With Postgres, the configuration would be:

DB_TYPE=postgres

DB_HOST=localhost

DB_PORT=5432

DB_USERNAME=postgres

DB_PASSWORD=postgres

DB_DATABASE=turbovets

TYPEORM_SYNC=false # use migrations in prod
(Optional) Generate apps if starting from an empty Nx workspace.

✨ Your new, shiny [Nx workspace](https://nx.dev) is almost ready ✨.

[Learn more about this workspace setup and its capabilities](https://nx.dev/getting-started/intro#learn-nx?utm_source=nx_project&amp;utm_medium=readme&amp;utm_campaign=nx_projects) or run `npx nx graph` to visually explore what was created. Now, let's get you up to speed!

## Run tasks

To run tasks with Nx use:

```sh
npx nx <target> <project-name>
```

For example:

```sh
npx nx build myproject
```

These targets are either [inferred automatically](https://nx.dev/concepts/inferred-tasks?utm_source=nx_project&utm_medium=readme&utm_campaign=nx_projects) or defined in the `project.json` or `package.json` files.

[More about running tasks in the docs &raquo;](https://nx.dev/features/run-tasks?utm_source=nx_project&utm_medium=readme&utm_campaign=nx_projects)

## Add new projects

While you could add new projects to your workspace manually, you might want to leverage [Nx plugins](https://nx.dev/concepts/nx-plugins?utm_source=nx_project&utm_medium=readme&utm_campaign=nx_projects) and their [code generation](https://nx.dev/features/generate-code?utm_source=nx_project&utm_medium=readme&utm_campaign=nx_projects) feature.

To install a new plugin you can use the `nx add` command. Here's an example of adding the React plugin:
```sh
npx nx add @nx/react
```

Use the plugin's generator to create new projects. For example, to create a new React app or library:

```sh
# Generate an app
npx nx g @nx/react:app demo

# Generate a library
npx nx g @nx/react:lib some-lib
```

You can use `npx nx list` to get a list of installed plugins. Then, run `npx nx list <plugin-name>` to learn about more specific capabilities of a particular plugin. Alternatively, [install Nx Console](https://nx.dev/getting-started/editor-setup?utm_source=nx_project&utm_medium=readme&utm_campaign=nx_projects) to browse plugins and generators in your IDE.

## Install Nx Console

Nx Console is an editor extension that enriches your developer experience. It lets you run tasks, generate code, and improves code autocompletion in your IDE. It is available for VSCode and IntelliJ.
